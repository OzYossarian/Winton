/* Ideally would implement with a generic delegate to do the actual rotation part. However, Swift doesn't currently allow this. Specifically, suppose we had:
 
 protocol RotationQueueDelegate
 {
    associatedType U
    func rotate(rotation: U)
 }
 
 And tried to include this as a property on our RotationQueue<T> class like so:
 
 class RotationQueue<T>
 {
    var delegate: RotationQueueDelegate
    ...
 }
 
 Then we get an error; we can't specify that the RotationQueueDelegate is going to be of type T as well. What we need is something like:
 
 protocol RotationQueueDelegate<U>
 {
    func rotate(rotation: U)
 }
 
 IMPORTANT: However, if what we were going to use as the delegate was specialised for the role (i.e. would implement the protocol and nothing more - wouldn't be a sublass of anything)
 then this approach works; make a generic wrapper class that just implements the protocol, then subclass this. RotationQueue would then look like:
 
 class RotationQueue<T>
 {
    var delegate: RotationQueueDelegateWrapper<T>
    ...
 }
